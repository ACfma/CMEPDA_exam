    tread_pool creates 4 lists contanining AD and CTRL paths and images as\
     long as the single files are:
    - .nii;
    - use the above nomenclature
    - belong to a unique (or with a same name) folder.
    This function uses SimpleITK for extracting the images.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sub : Iterable of string
        Iterable containing all the paths to the nifti files.

    Returns
    -------
    ad_images : list
        List of SimpleITK.Images.
    ad_path : list
        List of the paths (string format) to the images (in the same order as\
                                                          AD_images).

        download takes the path specified, extract the image from nifti file\
         and assign it and the path to two separate list.
        This process is used both for AD and CTRL but it could be done without\
         error only if there are no conflict in the names of folder and files\
         between paths.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : string
            Path to the selected nifti file.

        -------
        None.
